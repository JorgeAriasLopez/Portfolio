## Java

One of my first coding languages that I learn. I did most of my degree work with this language, even I used it the 90% of my first job. 

## C++

When I started working with this language was when the words **efficiency** and **optimization** took a biggger impact on me. Even nowadays I am still learning more about these terms.
